2.  **Firebase Studio - Frontend HTML CSS Mastery (like Paint / W3Schools):** The frontend is developed using Firebase Studio, focusing on HTML and CSS.
3.  **Markup Language - README and FlowCharts using Mermaid (like PowerPoint):** Documentation, including this README and flowcharts, is created using Markdown and Mermaid.
4.  **Database Management - Supabase SQL Tables (like Excel):** Supabase is used for database management with SQL tables.
5.  **AI Tools - Gemini / Jules / Windsurf / CODEX (like JavaScript Backend):** AI tools are leveraged for backend development and automation.
